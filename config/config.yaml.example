# -- Optional Global Options --
# no_pager: true            # turns off the automatic paged output (for longer outputs).  There is also a `--no-pager` flag.
# forget_account_after: 30  # The --account <account-name> flag allows you to switch between central accounts.  The setting is sticky
                            # so you don't have to keep re-entering the flag on every command.  This setting will cause it to revert
                            # back to the default account (under "central-info") 30 mins from the last command.
# other global options (true|false): debug, debugv (both default to false) ssl_verify (defaults to true)
